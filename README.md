    - Description: Implement a basic ML model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) and evaluate its performance. 
    - Why: Learning how to implement and evaluate models is foundational to ML. 
    - Tasks: 
      o Select an appropriate supervised learning algorithm for the dataset. 
      o Split the data into training and test sets.

  ## **3. [Create a Mini Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/kushagrapatidar/CodeSpaze_ML_Internship_Tasks/tree/main/Task_3_Create_a_Mini_Deep_Learning_Project):** Finished
    - Description: Implement a basic deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
    - Why: Deep learning is crucial for more complex machine learning tasks. 
    - Tasks: 
      o Choose a simple dataset (e.g., MNIST for image classification or IMDb for sentiment analysis). 
      o Build a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
      o Train and test the model, and visualize the learning process (e.g., loss curves, accuracy). 
      o Submit the model code, training logs, and evaluation report. 
      o Post the project on GitHub and share the link. 
  
  ## **4. [Dimensionality Reduction Techniques](https://github.com/kushagrapatidar/CodeSpaze_ML_Internship_Tasks/tree/main/Task_4_Dimensionality_Reduction_Techniques):** Under-development
    - Description: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize model performance by reducing the number of input features. 
    - Why: Reducing the dimensionality helps to eliminate redundant data, speeding up computations and improving model generalization. 
    - Tasks: 
      o Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset (e.g., the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset). 
      o Train a classification model on the reduced dataset and compare its performance with the original high-dimensional dataset. 
      o Analyze and report the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction and model performance. 
      o Submit the code and analysis, and upload a blog post on Medium or any other platform, sharing the link. 
  
  ## **5. [Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV](https://github.com/kushagrapatidar/CodeSpaze_ML_Internship_Tasks/tree/main/Task_5_Hyperparameter_Tuning_with_GridSearchCV_or_RandomizedSearchCV):** Under-development
    - Description: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of a machine learning model. 
    - Why: Hyperparameter tuning is essential to get the best possible performance from a machine learning model. 
    - Tasks: 
      o Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or SVM) on a dataset. 
      o Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters. 
      o Compare the model's performance with and without tuning. 
      o Submit the code with the analysis of the tuned hyperparameters, and upload the project on GitHub, sharing the link.
