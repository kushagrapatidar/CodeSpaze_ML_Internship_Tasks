# **CodeSpaze_ML_Internship_Tasks**

  ## **1. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    o Description: Perform data preprocessing and EDA on a real-world dataset using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 
    o Why: Proper data preprocessing is essential for successful machine learning model building. 
    o Tasks: 
      ▪ Choose a dataset from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
      ▪ Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize data, etc.). 
      ▪ Perform EDA, generate visualizations, and identify important patterns and correlations. 
      ▪ Submit a Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and conclusions. 
      ▪ Upload the project on GitHub and share the link. 
  
  ## **2. Build and Train a Simple Machine Learning Model:** 
    o Description: Implement a basic ML model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree) and evaluate its performance. 
    o Why: Learning how to implement and evaluate models is foundational to ML. 
    o Tasks: 
      ▪ Select an appropriate supervised learning algorithm for the dataset. 
      ▪ Split the data into training and test sets. 
      ▪ Train the model and evaluate it using performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). 
      ▪ Use cross-validation to improve model reliability. 
      ▪ Publish the project on GitHub, and submit a report explaining the model, performance, and conclusions. 
  
  ## **3. Create a Mini Deep Learning Project:**
    o Description: Implement a basic deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
    o Why: Deep learning is crucial for more complex machine learning tasks. 
    o Tasks: 
      ▪ Choose a simple dataset (e.g., MNIST for image classification or IMDb for sentiment analysis). 
      ▪ Build a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
      ▪ Train and test the model, and visualize the learning process (e.g., loss curves, accuracy). 
      ▪ Submit the model code, training logs, and evaluation report. 
      ▪ Post the project on GitHub and share the link. 
  
  ## **4. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:** 
    o Description: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize model performance by reducing the number of input features. 
    o Why: Reducing the dimensionality helps to eliminate redundant data, speeding up computations and improving model generalization. 
    o Tasks: 
      • Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset (e.g., the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset). 
      • Train a classification model on the reduced dataset and compare its performance with the original high-dimensional dataset. 
      • Analyze and report the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction and model performance. 
      • Submit the code and analysis, and upload a blog post on Medium or any other platform, sharing the link. 
  
  ## **5. Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV:** 
    o Description: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of a machine learning model. 
    o Why: Hyperparameter tuning is essential to get the best possible performance from a machine learning model. 
    o Tasks: 
      • Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or SVM) on a dataset. 
      • Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters. 
      • Compare the model's performance with and without tuning. 
      • Submit the code with the analysis of the tuned hyperparameters, and upload the project on GitHub, sharing the link.
